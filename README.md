## Ada-Essay-Questions

Question 1  

Programming is something that I thought I could never do. I never considered myself capable of making a career in STEM—that was meant for 
the smartest people.  However, for the last few months I have had a yearning to learn more, to challenge myself, believing that I am   
capable and that there is a place for me. I am naturally a shy person, and sometimes have trouble speaking up. A lot of the times I turn   
to art for truth, and validation for who I am. In the same way, learning how to code is empowering because even though my voice shakes   
sometimes, I know that I am determined and intelligent even when I have to work three times as hard. After reading about Ada’s vision, and 
watching videos from people who have gone through the program, I felt encouraged, and I felt like someone believed in me. I am interested 
in programming because of the possibility of a career that is challenging, fulfilling, and can one day help me support more than myself.  
And one day I hope to combine my love for art and creativity with programming.

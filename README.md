Question 1  

Programming is something that I thought I could never do. I never considered myself capable of making a career 
in STEM, something that was meant for the smartest people.  However, for the last few months I have had a yearning to learn more, to
challenge myself, while believing that I am capable and that there is a place for me in a field like programming. 
Although I am naturally a shy person, and sometimes have trouble speaking up, there are things that I find empowering. Art, specifically 
photography, gives me in a voice. And in the same way, learning code will enable me to have a bolder voice, and to be able to tell myself 
that I can dream big. 

For too long I had been afraid of tackling science or math, sometimes even english because I thought I was not smart enough. But this past 
year I have found confidence in my passion to do more for my family, myself, and the world. I am a creative being, and I am realizing that
it does not mean that I have to follow a certain path to be a "true artist." I can expand my knowledge and challenge myself in areas like
technology, where people are also changing the world. Programming needs voices like ours--women who did not necessarily grow up with elite
education, or homes where fields in techonogoly and science were valued, but women who have knowledge of the world, who can think 
critically, and can tackle problems.  

I have exposed myself to programming by taking advantage of any free trials offered by sources like Codeacademy, Treehouse, 
and Skillcrush. I also look up Youtube videos on coding to discover resources and learning techniques that people use to learn languages.
Apart from that, reading articles about women in software engineering keeps me motivated.  There are a lot of risks and challenges 
that people who change careers take, but they're making a better world by representing people who are not 

Question 2

If I am accepted into the program, I see myself confidentally sharing ideas, and solutions to a team that is working on projects
aimed to be accesible for all. Equally important, I see myself working on projects related to art. I went to Chicago Public Schools my 
whole life, and Art was always one of my favorite classes. However, in the past few years the government has taken away a lot of the
funding for art programs. But I believe in the power of science and art and math and reading; these areas intersect, and they are 
important. In five years, I see myself working with educators and people working For so long 
I believed I had to either be an artist or be a business person or engineer, but it does not have to be that way. I can choose to learn 
more, to be a part of things that I never thought were for me. In five years, I want my family and the people from my city to know that 
there are endless poissibilities and also resources and people who care about both art and science. 

Question 3

Sometimes I wake up in the morning wanting to crawl into a hole of deep saddness for everything that is happening in the world. Everything
from natural disasters, DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) being threatened, the acts of violenece towards people of 
color that happen every day, racism, and more-- it all makes it easy for me to feel pessimistic about the world. It makes it hard for
me to dream of a better place because the United States of America has not been a great place for many people. But at the same time,
people waking up every morning to go to work to feed their families, the people who risk their lives and safety for their loved ones or
for themselves give strength and give me hope. My parents are immigrants from Mexico, and I feel a sense of responisbilty to care for 
them. I feel a sense of responsibilty to make them proud and take advantage of the opportunities that I have to have a voice in places 
that are not "meant" for me. I want to be able to work on projects that are designed by mainly white males because a lot of technology is 
used by people who do not fit that category. 

Question 4 
There are a lot of mistakes that I have made, especially the ones I took before entering college and during my first couple of years. I have always been a shy person and sometimes that holds me back. Before applying to college, I was not sure I wanted to go. I was always a good student and felt like that was the path I should take. It would make my educators and family proud, but if I were to do it again, I would look for mentors, and take advantage of resources. If I could speak to my younger self, I would say to believe that I can. I would tell myself to dream big. I have made the mistake of

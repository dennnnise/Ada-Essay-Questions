## Ada-Essay-Questions  
#### Dennise Ortega  

Question 1  

Programming is something that I thought I could never do. I never considered myself capable of making a career 
in STEM—that was meant for the smartest people.  However, for the last few months I have had a yearning to learn more, to challenge 
myself, believing that I am capable and that there is a place for me. I am naturally a shy person, and sometimes have trouble speaking up. 
A lot of the times I turn to art for truth, and validation for who I am. In the same way, learning how to code is empowering because even 
though my voice shakes sometimes, I know that I am determined and intelligent even when I have to work three times as hard. After reading 
about Ada’s vision, and watching videos from people who have gone through the program, I felt encouraged, and I felt like someone believed 
in me. I am interested in programming because of the possibility of a career that is challenging, fulfilling, and can one day help me 
support more than myself. And one day I hope to combine my love for art and creativity with programming.

I have exposed myself to programming by taking advantage of any free trials offered by differentresources like Codeacademy, Treehouse, and
Skillcrush. I also look up Youtube videos on coding to discover resources and learning techniques that people use to learn languages.
Apart from that, reading articles about women in software engineering keeps me motivated.  There are risks, and challenges, but they’re
changing the world. 

Question 2

If I am accepted into the program, I see myself confidentally sharing ideas, and solutions to a team of people who are working on projects
aimed to help people's lives. I see myself working on projects related to art as well because art and science are not two completely
different things. The importance of both in people's lives is grand. I went to Chicago Public Schools my whole life. Art was always one 
of my favorite classes. However, in the past few years the government had taken away a lot of the funding for art programs. Art and 
science are important, and you don't have to pick one or the other. For so long I believed I had to either be an artist or be a business
person or engineer, but it does not have to be that way. I can choose to learn more, to be a part of things that I never thought were for 
me. In five years, I want my family and the people from my city to know that there are endless poissibilities and also resources and 
people who care about both art and science.

## Ada-Essay-Questions  
#### Dennise Ortega  

Question 1  

Programming is something that I thought I could never do. I never considered myself capable of making a career 
in STEM, something that was meant for the smartest people.  However, for the last few months I have had a yearning to learn more, to
challenge myself, while believing that I am capable and that there is a place for me in a field like programming. 
Although I am naturally a shy person, and sometimes have trouble speaking up, there are things that I find empowering. Art, specifically 
photography, gives me in a voice. And in the same way, learning code will enable me to have a bolder voice, and to be able to tell myself 
that I can dream big. 

For too long I had been afraid of tackling science or math, sometimes even english because I thought I was not smart enough. But this past 
year I have found confidence in my passion to do more for my family, myself, and the world. I am a creative being, and I am realizing that
it does not mean that I have to follow a certain path to be a "true artist." I can expand my knowledge and challenge myself in areas like
technology, where people are also changing the world. Programming needs voices like ours--women who did not necessarily grow up with elite
education, or homes where fields in techonogoly and science were valued, but women who have knowledge of the world, who can think 
critically, and can tackle problems.  

I have exposed myself to programming by taking advantage of any free trials offered by sources like Codeacademy, Treehouse, 
and Skillcrush. I also look up Youtube videos on coding to discover resources and learning techniques that people use to learn languages.
Apart from that, reading articles about women in software engineering keeps me motivated.  There are a lot of risks and challenges 
that people who change careers take, but they're making a better world. 

Question 2

If I am accepted into the program, I see myself confidentally sharing ideas, and solutions to a team that is working on projects
aimed to be accesible for all. Equally important, I see myself working on projects related to art. I went to Chicago Public Schools my 
whole life, and Art was always one of my favorite classes. I expressed myself freely and was encouraged to explore ideas. However, in the 
past few years the government has taken away a lot of funding for art programs. However, I believe in the power of science, art, math 
and reading; these areas intersect, and they are important. In five years, I see myself working with educators and programmers to create 
technology  that allows students to learn about different subjects areas. I want to help students who are "othered" to believe in 
themselves and to encourage them to explore their interests. Growning up I believed I had to either be an artist or be a business person, 
but a lot of things intersect. One can choose to learn more, and to be a part of things that you never thought were for you. In 
five years, I want my family and the people from my city to know that there are endless poissibilities and also resources for people 
who care about both art and science. 

Question 3

There are times when I wake up in the morning wanting to crawl into a hole of deep saddness for everything that is happening in the world. 
Everything from natural disasters, DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) being threatened, the acts of violenece towards people of 
color that happen every day, racism, and more--it all makes it easy for me to feel pessimistic about the world. It makes it hard for
me to dream of a better place because the United States of America has not been a great place for many people. But at the same time, 
organizations like Ada working to make spaces more inclusive, and making it possible for people to achieve their desires give me a lot 
of hope and strength. Reading Ada's mission statement encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone, and I will contribute to it by 
remaining open to learning and working with people that are different than me.


Another way that I will contribute to Ada's mission statement is by learning new skillsets that will enable me to have a voice in Tech, 
which is mostly made up of white males. There needs to be diversity in Tech because the people who use techonology are diverse. 
Actually, I am recently inspired by Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. She created a collection of beauty products for all 
different shades and personalities. Her ad campaign is made up of models that are diverse in attitude and skin color. A woman of color 
made beauty prooducts for women of color. There needs to be more of that in the Tech industry as well, where people of color are also 
contributing to projects that will be used by humans of all different bakcgrounds.  

My parents are immigrants from Mexico, and I feel a sense of responisbilty to care for them. I feel a sense of responsibilty to make them 
proud and take advantage of the opportunities this country gives me. I want to be able to provide for them the same way they have for me. 
And Ada's mission statement gives me confidence in that hope. Ada makes me believe that I can be a part of a field that will allow me to 
do that, and it would not be fair to myself to pass up the opportunity to apply. 

Question 4 

There are a lot of mistakes that I have made, especially the ones I took during my first couple of years of college. Being a timid 
person has been difficult because of the fact that it takes a lot from me to speak up. However, if I were to start something completely
new like college again, I would tell myself that it is okay to ask for help. If I were to talk to my younger self, I would say that 
there are people willing to help. I suffered a lot from anxiety my first couple of years of college but I was always too afraid to tell 
anyone, to the point that it affected my performance in school. I would tell myself that it is okay to push myself in incraments, that I 
do not have to be a completely different person in one day. I would tell myself that it is okay to struggle, and that being shy or 
different does not make me less worthy of a good life/good education. I would take advantage of resources and look for a community that
is caring. Not speaking up has been a mistake that I have made not only once, but several times. It is also one that I am constantly 
learning from. I have learned to trust myself and my abilities. I have also learned to listen to what others have to say, and to consider 
their words honestly and critically. People have a lot to offer.
